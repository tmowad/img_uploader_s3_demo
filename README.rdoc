To use this scrappy uploader, you'll need to add your security credentials
to the file img_uploader_s3_init.sh, and then run that file as 
"source img_uploader_s3_init.sh" so that your shell's environment is
modified to include the AWS credentials.  I left my bucket name in my
source code, but you'd have to change that as well.  

This is just a really amateur rendition of how to upload files, since I
wasn't sure of how to do it before.
